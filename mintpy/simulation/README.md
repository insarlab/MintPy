## Simulation Toolbox for Interferometric Phase

This module collects some toolbox to simulate different components of interferometric phases, such as the decorrelation noise, tropospheric turbulence and surface deformation, etc. 

This toolbox is still in **alpha** stage, which means they will change quite frequently. 

There are no comprehensive document on this part yet. If you want to give them a try, read the detailed function usage in the code.
