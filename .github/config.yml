  💖  Thanks for opening this pull request! Please check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). 💖

  Keep in mind that all new features should be documented. It helps to write the comments next to the code or below your functions describing **all** arguments, and return types before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and usually results in better code.
