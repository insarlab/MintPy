## Simulation Toolbox for Interferometric Phase

This module collects some toolbox to simulate different components of interferometric phases, such as the decorrelation noise, tropospheric turbulence and surface deformation, etc.

🚨 This toolbox is still in **alpha** stage and undergoing **rapid development**. 🚨

There are no comprehensive document on this part yet. If you want to give them a try, read the detailed function usage in the code.
